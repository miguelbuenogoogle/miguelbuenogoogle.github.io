Designed for undergraduate students in Business Administration and Economics, this algebra-based course examines how individual economic agents make choices within a market system. Topics include economic theory, rationality, consumer and producer choice, market equilibrium, and elasticity. The course explores the effects of market interventions, analyzes welfare and efficiency, and examines trade, externalities, and the labor market. Additional emphasis is placed on inequality, social insurance, and poverty, as well as firm behavior under different market structures, including perfect and imperfect competition. Students are introduced to strategic decision-making through game theory, long-run market dynamics such as entry and exit, and the role of uncertainty and imperfect information in shaping economic outcomes.
